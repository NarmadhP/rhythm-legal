        <p>Narmadh P ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Rhythm mobile application ("the App" or "the Service"). This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

        <p>We use the following third-party services that may collect or process information:</p>
        
        <h3>3.1 Firebase Authentication</h3>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take data security seriously:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p><strong>Health and Medication Data:</strong> This data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App. We do not retain copies of this data.</p>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>6.2 Data Portability</h3>
        <p>Since your health data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. You can export or backup this data using your device's backup features.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Service is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from children under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
        
        <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.

        <h2>10. Data Breach Notification</h2>
        <p>In the event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will notify you and relevant authorities as required by applicable law. Given that health data is stored locally on your device, the risk of such breaches affecting your health information is minimized.</p>
        
        <h2>11. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
        <p>Some browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Currently, there is no standard for how DNT signals should be interpreted. We do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or mechanisms.</p>
