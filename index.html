        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: <span id="lastUpdated"></span></p>
        
        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>

            <li>CSV and PDF export of medication data</li>
            <li>Anonymous authentication with no email or password required</li>

            <li>Free trial with graceful downgrade to free tier upon expiration</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use this Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Anonymous User Identification</h2>
        <p>The Service uses anonymous authentication and does not require email addresses, passwords, or personal information to create an account. Instead:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A unique anonymous identifier (UUID) is automatically generated and stored securely on your device</li>
            <li>On iOS: Your identifier is stored in iOS Keychain with optional iCloud Keychain sync</li>
            <li>On Android: Your identifier is stored in Encrypted Shared Preferences with optional Android backup</li>
            <li>This identifier is used solely for subscription management through RevenueCat</li>
            <li>You may optionally create a recovery secret phrase to restore your subscription on new devices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeping your device secure (passcode, biometrics) as your data is stored locally</li>
            <li>Safely storing your recovery secret phrase if you create one</li>
            <li>All activities that occur on your device using the Service</li>
            <li>Understanding that uninstalling the app will delete your local data and anonymous identifier</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>No Personal Data Required:</strong> We cannot identify you personally, and we do not collect your name, email, phone number, or other personally identifiable information.</p>
        
        <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>

            <li>Use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms</li>
            <li>Provide accurate medication information</li>
            <li>Consult with healthcare professionals regarding your medication schedule</li>
            <li>Not use the Service in any way that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair our servers or networks</li>

        <h2>6. Data Storage and Privacy</h2>

        <p><strong>Optional Cloud Sync (Premium Feature):</strong> If you subscribe to Premium and enable cloud sync, your medication database is synced to your personal cloud storage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Synced to your private iCloud Drive container (<code>iCloud.com.rhythm.medapp</code>), accessible only to your Apple ID</li>
            <li><strong>Android:</strong> Synced to your private Google Drive AppData folder (hidden from Google Drive UI), accessible only by this app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cloud sync is disabled by default, requires Premium subscription, and can be toggled on/off at any time in Settings.</p>
        <p><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> We use minimal third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For subscription management using your anonymous identifier</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> For anonymous crash reporting and error logs</li>
            <li><strong>Apple/Google Cloud Storage:</strong> Only if you enable cloud sync (optional, premium-only)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please review our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for detailed information about data handling, security, and your rights.</p>
